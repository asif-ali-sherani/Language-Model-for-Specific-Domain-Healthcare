There is no known cure for retinitis pigmentosa. However, there are few treatment options such as light avoidance and/or the use of low-vision aids to slow down the progression of RP. Some practitioners also consider vitamin A as a possible treatment option to slow down the progression of RP. Research suggests taking high doses of vitamin A (15,000 IU/day) may slow progression a little in some people, but the results are not strong. Taking too much vitamin A can be toxic and the effects of vitamin A on the disease is relatively weak. More research must be conducted before this is a widely accepted form of therapy.  Research is also being conducted in areas such as gene therapy research, transplant research, and retinal prosthesis. Since RP is usually the result of a defective gene, gene therapy has become a widely explored area for future research. The goal of such research would be to discover ways healthy genes can be inserted into the retina. Attempts at transplanting healthy retinal cells into sick retinas are being made experimentally and have not yet been considered as clinically safe and successful. Retinal prosthesis is also an important area of exploration because the prosthesis, a man-made device intended to replace a damaged body part, can be designed to take over the function of the lost photoreceptors by electrically stimulating the remaining healthy cells of the retina.Through electrical stimulation, the activated ganglion cells can provide a visual signal to the brain. The visual scene captured by a camera is transmitted via electromagnetic radiation to a small decoder chip located on the retinal surface. Data and power are then sent to a set of electrodes connected to the decoder. Electrical current passing from individual electrodes stimulate cells in the appropriate areas of the retina corresponding to the features in the visual scene.\",\n          \"People can clench and grind without being aware of it. It can happen during both the day and night, although sleep-related bruxism is often a bigger problem because it is harder to control.  There is some disagreement about the cause of bruxism. Daily stress may be the trigger in many people. Some people probably clench their teeth and never feel symptoms.   Factors that influence whether or not bruxism causes pain and other problems will vary from person to person. They may include:   -  How much stress you are under   -  How long and tightly you clench and grind   -  Whether your teeth are misaligned   -  Your posture   -  Your ability to relax   -  Your diet   -  Your sleeping habits, Bruxism (BRUK-siz-um) is a condition in which you grind, gnash or clench your teeth. If you have bruxism, you may unconsciously clench your teeth together during the day, or clench or grind them at night (sleep bruxism).  Sleep bruxism is considered a sleep-related movement disorder. People who clench or grind their teeth (brux) during sleep are more likely to have other sleep disorders, such as snoring and pauses in breathing (sleep apnea).  Mild bruxism may not require treatment. However, in some people, bruxism can be frequent and severe enough to lead to jaw disorders, headaches, damaged teeth and other problems.  Because you may have sleep bruxism and be unaware of it until complications develop, it's important to know the signs and symptoms of bruxism and to seek regular dental care.\",\n          \"REFLUX TREATMENT  Gastroesophageal reflux disease is treated according to its severity.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}],"source":["training_dataset.head(10)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"8d482be4","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"id":"8d482be4","outputId":"8ccd2781-c286-40bd-c20d-2d3e6eb3ce47","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714457937826,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Lone Some","userId":"14896582024244019833"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["Question    2\n","Answer      0\n","dtype: int64"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":10}],"source":["training_dataset.isnull().sum()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"a57e1fc4","metadata":{"id":"a57e1fc4"},"outputs":[],"source":["training_dataset = training_dataset.dropna()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"6e96a944","metadata":{"id":"6e96a944","outputId":"6a3ad8fd-7a68-4812-d60a-d028b08fbfd1","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714457937827,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Lone Some","userId":"14896582024244019833"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["Question    0\n","Answer      0\n","dtype: int64"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":12}],"source":["training_dataset.isnull().sum()"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["training_dataset.shape"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Mf4k9FaIZbUd","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714457937828,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Lone Some","userId":"14896582024244019833"}},"outputId":"59592991-4a1b-4df9-f6c2-b30496d74762"},"id":"Mf4k9FaIZbUd","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(444, 2)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"5fb9ca62","metadata":{"id":"5fb9ca62"},"outputs":[],"source":["#training_dataset.to_csv('training_data.csv')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"37f01101","metadata":{"id":"37f01101"},"source":["### Test Dataset"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"2b32c9a2","metadata":{"id":"2b32c9a2"},"outputs":[],"source":["test_data_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Masters Thesis - Project/LiveQA_MedicalTask_TREC2017-master/TestDataset/TREC-2017-LiveQA-Medical-Test.xml'"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"64e23f01","metadata":{"id":"64e23f01"},"outputs":[],"source":["tree = ET.parse(test_data_path)  # Replace with your actual file path\n","root = tree.getroot()\n","\n","# Initialize lists to store question-answer pairs\n","question_list = []\n","answer_list = []\n","\n","# Extract question-answer pairs\n","for question_elem in root.findall('NLM-QUESTION'):\n","    question_text = question_elem.find('Original-Question/MESSAGE').text\n","    answers = [answer_elem.text for answer_elem in question_elem.findall('.//ANSWER')]\n","\n","    # Concatenate different answers for the same question\n","    concatenated_answers = ', '.join(answers)\n","\n","    # Append to lists\n","    question_list.append(question_text)\n","    answer_list.append(concatenated_answers)\n","\n","# Create DataFrame\n","test_dataset = pd.DataFrame({'Question': question_list, 'Answers': answer_list})"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["test_dataset.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"3Rv4T_yBJEgZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714457938272,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Lone Some","userId":"14896582024244019833"}},"outputId":"ef517b65-4def-44ce-c175-97c2d383d3ea"},"id":"3Rv4T_yBJEgZ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                            Question  \\\n","0  What are the references with noonan syndrome a...   \n","1  Re:NDC# 0115-0672-50 Zolmitriptan tabkets 5mg....   \n","2                             are they gluten free\\t   \n","3   vdrl positive patients please tell me what ar...   \n","4   How much glucose is in my GlucaGen HypoKit ? ...   \n","\n","                                             Answers  \n","0   Noonan's syndrome is an eponymic designation ...  \n","1  Zolmitriptan tablets are available as 2.5 mg (...  \n","2  \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tActive Ingredients\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAmph...  \n","3   Syphilis\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIf the RPR, VDRL, or TRUS...  \n","4   GLUCAGEN\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tglucagon hydrochloride in...

However, an infested person can transmit scabies, even if they do not have symptoms. Scabies usually is passed by direct, prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tinfested person. However, a person with crusted (Norwegian) scabies can spread the infestation by brief skin-to-skin contact or by exposure to bedding, clothing, or even furniture that he/she has used.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tScabies is prevented by avoiding direct skin-to-skin contact with an infested person or with items such as clothing or bedding used by an infested person. Scabies treatment usually is recommended for members of the same household, particularly for those who have had prolonged skin-to-skin contact. All\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thousehold members and other potentially exposed persons should be treated at the same time as the infested person to prevent possible reexposure and reinfestation. Bedding and clothing worn or used next to the skin anytime during the 3 days before treatment should be machine washed and dried\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tusing the hot water and hot dryer cycles or be dry-cleaned. Items that cannot be dry-cleaned or laundered can be disinfested by storing in a closed plastic bag for several days to a week. Scabies mites generally do not survive more than 2 to 3 days away from human skin. Children and adults\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tusually can return to child care, school, or work the day after treatment.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPersons with crusted scabies and their close contacts, including household members, should be treated rapidly and aggressively to avoid outbreaks. Institutional outbreaks can be difficult to control and require a rapid, aggressive, and sustained response.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRooms used by a patient with crusted scabies should be thoroughly cleaned and vacuumed after use.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t, Products used to treat scabies are called scabicides because they kill scabies mites; some also kill mite eggs. Scabicides used to treat human scabies are available only with a doctor's prescription. No \\\"over-the-counter\\\" (non-prescription) products have been tested and approved to treat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tscabies.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tScabicide lotion or cream should be applied to all areas of the body from the neck down to the feet and toes. In addition, when treating infants and young children, scabicide lotion or cream also should be applied to their entire head and neck because scabies can affect their face, scalp, and neck, as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twell as the rest of their body. Only permethrin or sulfur ointment may be used in infants. The lotion or cream should be applied to a clean body and left on for the recommended time before washing it off. Clean clothing should be worn after treatment. Both sexual and close personal contacts who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thave had direct prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an infested person within the preceding month should be examined and treated. All persons should be treated at the same time to prevent reinfestation.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t, \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tScabies treatment involves eliminating the infestation with medications. Several creams and lotions are available with a doctor's prescription. You usually apply the medication over all your body, from your neck down, and leave the medication on for at least eight hours. A second treatment is needed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif new burrows and rash appear.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBecause scabies spreads so easily, your doctor will likely recommend treatment for all household members and other close contacts, even if they show no signs of scabies infestation.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMedications commonly prescribed for scabies include:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPermethrin cream, 5 percent (Elimite). Permethrin is a topical cream that contains chemicals that kill scabies mites and their eggs. It is generally considered safe for adults, pregnant women, and children ages 2 months and older. This medicine is not recommended for nursing mothers.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLindane lotion. This medication - also a chemical treatment - is recommended only for people who can't tolerate other approved treatments, or for whom other treatments didn't work. This medication isn't safe for children younger than age 2 years, women who are pregnant or nursing, the elderly, or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tanyone who weighs less than 110 pounds (50 kilograms).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCrotamiton (Eurax). This medication is available as a cream or a lotion. It's applied once a day for two days. This medication isn't recommended for children or for women who are pregnant or nursing.
