If you are on menopausal hormone therapy, talk with your health care provider about whether or not to stop it.Also ask about the best way to discontinue the treatment.You can stop abruptly or by gradually reducing the dose over several months.With either method of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tstopping the medication, you may have menopause-like symptoms.\",\n          \" Noonan's syndrome is an eponymic designation that has been used during the last 8 years to describe a variable constellation of somatic and visceral congenital anomalies, which includes groups of patients previously referred to as male Turner's, female pseudo-Turner's and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBonnevie-Ullrich syndromes. It is now recognized that both sexes may show the stigmas of this condition and, unlike Turner's syndrome, there is no karyotype abnormality although there is often a familial pattern. The most commonly observed anomalies include webbing of the neck, hypertelorism, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tshield-shaped chest and short stature. Congenital heart disease, principally pulmonary stenosis, and sexual infantilism often with cryptorchidism in the male subject are additional associated anomalies in this syndrome. Renal anomalies have been described rarely and usually consist of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trotational errors, duplications and hydronephrosis. We report the first case of an infant who displayed many of the stigmas of Noonan's syndrome and also showed early evidence of frank renal failure secondary to renal dysplasia with cystic disease. , 10% of patients with Noonan syndrome have renal abnormalities but most do not need treatment., Genitourinary. Renal abnormalities, generally mild, are present in 11% of individuals with NS. Dilatation of the renal pelvis is most common. Duplex collecting systems, minor rotational anomalies, distal ureteric stenosis, renal hypoplasia, unilateral renal agenesis, unilateral renal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tectopia, and bilateral cysts with scarring are reported less commonly.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":3}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["test_d.shape"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"5cqahi9bFHwG","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714493255300,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Lone Some","userId":"14896582024244019833"}},"outputId":"07a0cbdf-1998-456f-b034-7c8532e8a566"},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(26, 3)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Predicted Dataset\n","pre_d = pd.read_csv(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Masters Thesis - Project/Model Evaluation/predicted_answers.csv\")\n","pre_d.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"DFh9IfP1C47u","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714493256243,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":946,"user":{"displayName":"Lone Some","userId":"14896582024244019833"}},"outputId":"554de1e4-fa10-4ae8-f6e4-fa1b33eb5c0e"},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   Unnamed: 0                                           Question  \\\n","0           0  What are the references with noonan syndrome a...   \n","1           1  Re:NDC# 0115-0672-50 Zolmitriptan tabkets 5mg....   \n","2           2                             are they gluten free\\t   \n","3           3   vdrl positive patients please tell me what ar...   \n","4           4   How much glucose is in my GlucaGen HypoKit ? ...   \n","\n","                                    Predicted Answer  \n","0   Noonan syndrome is a genetic disorder that af...  \n","1   Zolmitriptan is an oral medication that is us...  \n","2   Gluten-free diet  A gluten-free diet is a die...  \n","3   Diagnosis  Your health care provider will per...  \n","4   The amount of glucose in GlucaGen HypoKit var...
